We love new ideas! If you have an idea for a new feature (like a new "delivery agent" for messages) or an enhancement to an existing one, please create an issue in the appropriate repository.

-   For app features, use the [app repository issues](https://github.com/AgeOfKindness/app/issues).
-   For backend or API ideas, use the [backend repository issues](https://github.com/AgeOfKindness/backend/issues).

Please provide a clear description of the feature, why it would be valuable, and any other context that might be helpful.
