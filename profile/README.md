## Our Mission

**Age of Kindness** is a global digital art project aimed at connecting people through positive, anonymous messages. In a world that often feels divided, we believe that small, simple acts of kindness can create powerful ripples of change.

Our core application allows users to send a message of encouragement from their location to any other place on Earth, visualized on a real-time 3D globe.

## Our Philosophy

This project is built on a foundation of trust, positivity, and open-source principles.

-   **Privacy First:** The app is designed to be anonymous. We do not track users or sell data.
-   **Positivity Guaranteed:** All messages are vetted by an AI moderation system to ensure the space remains safe and uplifting.
-   **Open Source:** All our code is public. We believe in transparency and the power of community collaboration.
-   **Non-Commercial:** This project is a labor of love. Any "donations" are used to keep the servers running or are directed to vetted charitable causes.

## Our Repositories

-   [**app**](https://github.com/AgeOfKindness/app): The core Unity 3D application for iOS and Android.
-   [**backend**](https://github.com/AgeOfKindness/backend): The serverless Firebase backend for our API and AI moderation.
